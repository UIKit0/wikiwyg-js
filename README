^ Wikiwyg - A Multi-Mode Wiki Editor

Wikiwyg is a WYSIWYG browser editor framework for wikis.

It is designed to be pluggable on top of existing wiki engines,
with little or no change to the wiki engine's core software.

^^ Demo Setup

> % perl start.pl
> main: You can connect to your server at http://localhost:8080/

Note how you can switch between Richtext and Wikitext modes.

For supported syntax see:
